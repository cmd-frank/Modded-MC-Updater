# Update-Server
A simple program to update your modded minecraft server if it uses the serverstarter.jar using the SSH.NET library

# Instructions
Fill the hostname, port, username, password, Minecraft directory location and serverstarter.jar name before compiling to work properly

Run the program, select the .yaml config file and click update

# TODO:
- Allow the user to set their hostname, port, username, password, Minecraft directory location and serverstarter.jar name in the program itself
- Show the update results in realtime instead of "freezing" and displaying the information after it's done
